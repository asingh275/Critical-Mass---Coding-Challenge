# Critical-Mass---Coding-Challenge

## Projects
1. __Another Covid Tracker:__   
Github repo: https://github.com/GurpinderBisla/Covid-Tracker  
Website link: https://gurpinderbisla.github.io/Covid-Tracker/#/  
SDLC: Scrum  
In this project I worked with 3 other team members to make a website for Global and Canada's covid statistics. For this project we choose scrum agile model which gave us flexibility to adapt to any changes in the project and tackle problems collectively, it also came handy when api I was working with went down and then in the meeting I discuss this matter with my team members and we decided to work with another api and excluded some functionalities from our project.  
In this project I worked on the Global part of the website and two pages global stats and compare country stats. On the global site I showed total number of deaths and cases cards and also showed world map which was made by geo-charts. If user selects country from the drop down menu it shows covid stats specific to that country. On ther country compare page user can compare the covid stats and I represented that stats on a line chart.  
When this project was started I was not familiar with React but when I started, I learned it and catch up with my team members. We used chakra-ui instead CSS, I also learned that and made footer, header, and logo of this project.

NOTE: The Canadian webpages are not working as they were before because api we used, they changed the format of their output and now as we are all students we have exams going on we decided to solve this issue after exams.

2. __Dental-Clinic-Appointment-Management-Database:__  
Github repo: https://github.com/asingh275/Dental-Clinic-Appointment-Management-Database  
This is a database group project which was part of my academic course. On this project I worked with 1 other team member to create a full database from a little description provided. We started from adding more description and assumptions. This is a dental clinic appointment database where user can book an appointment with dentist of this clinic. It also keeps track of user's payments and appointments.  
In this project I worked on Enhanced Entity-Relation (EER) Diagram, helped team member with normalizing and worked on queries of My_SQL. I was good at sql so I completed most of the queries. From this project I learned how to solve real world problems and learned to make assumptions for real world scenarios using user stories.  

3. __Hero-Villain-API:__  
Github repo: https://github.com/asingh275/API  
Working with Node.js made an API to store the information of villain, hero and location where hero and villain might fight. In this poject I created different api routes for getting and posting information. Created models for sanitizing the information and sending error message if information is not in correct format. Used MongoDB for database and used mongoose for creating and updating hero, villain and location's objects. From this project I sharpened my skills in back-end and learned how to manage different routes for server and use models for sanitizing request data.

## Inspiration  
1. Self-driving cars: I am inspired by how technology is evolving faster and faster. Now, we have self-driving cars. I am always inpired by these great works which have capability to change the world. From technical prospective I am inspired how these cars recognize their environment and act that fast according to changed around them. I can say that it all started with face recognization and AI and how it growing further and further.
2. Devon Crawford: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA I am following this youtuber who also is a programmer and always bring new challenges in his videos and try to solve them. He also inspired me how to approach a problem and solve part of problem one by one and think then program.  

## Focus
I am excited to hone my collaboration skills by working with others and to enhance my coding skills. If given time and resources I would focus on developing a quality and reusable code and work collaboratively in a team. I can learn quickly so if there are any other technologies used in the company I will spend my time to learn that skills so that when in need I can contribute.  

## Code Challenge  
Github repo: https://github.com/asingh275/CriticalMass-CodingChallenge  
CodeSandbox link: https://codesandbox.io/s/relaxed-banach-0vq3m7  

To categorize and sort I loop over the menuItems and put all the items in an array of same type. These types are keys to the object categories. So, this categories object have keys of types and this keys have array as value with items having same item type. Now all the menu-items are categorised and sorted in an object which makes it easier to access every item.  
To render these items I created a function where I am created html elements and appending them in the same section as their type. For styling I added left and right borders to display italian flag colors and then used this theme to display items in appropriated section. Also, added checkbox option at top to show spicy menu-items, if unchecked spicy items are not shown.
